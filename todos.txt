- continue to simplify the code
- try to integrate draft.js
- add tooltip & toasts

/* const importAll = r => {
    return r.keys().map(r);
};

 const images = importAll(
     require.context(
         './../../../assets/albumCovers/',
         false,
         /\.(png|jpe?g|svg)$/
     )
 );
 figure out how to assign specific
 images to specific review entries */

 - work on styling especially on page layouts
 - add a timer to the user model for auth tokens
